## Project Overview

The **Navigation System Redesign** was a UX/UI-driven project focused on reimagining the internal navigation for a service platform. The previous system struggled with scalability, clarity, and mobile usability. Our objective was to create a modern, intuitive, and user-centered navigation framework that could grow with the platform’s evolving needs.

## Role & Responsibilities

As the lead designer on this project, I managed the full UX/UI lifecycle:

- Conducted stakeholder interviews and audited existing navigation flows
- Developed wireframes and prototypes using **Figma**
- Built and documented a consistent visual language
- Collaborated with developers to implement responsive designs in **React**
- Ensured accessibility and usability across all breakpoints

## Design Process

### 1. Discovery & Research

We started with user interviews and analytics to uncover key usability issues. Users reported confusion, inconsistent paths, and difficulty accessing critical tools—especially on mobile.

### 2. Wireframing & Prototyping

Using **Figma**, I created multiple wireframe iterations. Interactive prototypes were tested internally to validate layout logic and task flows.

### 3. Visual Design System

We established a clean, modular component library with consistent spacing, iconography, and typography. The visual language was designed to scale and remain accessible.

### 4. Implementation

Working closely with developers, I translated designs into responsive, component-based **React** code. We used **CSS** custom properties and utility classes to maintain maintainability and performance.

## Results

- ✅ **35% decrease** in time-to-complete core tasks
- ✅ Increased internal user satisfaction (via feedback surveys)
- ✅ A future-ready navigation system that supports continued platform growth

---

## Tools Used

- **Figma** – Design, wireframing, prototyping
- **React** – Front-end implementation
- **CSS** – Responsive styling and layout
- **Notion & FigJam** – Documentation and collaboration

---

## Key Takeaways

This project reinforced the importance of user validation, cross-functional collaboration, and building scalable design systems. The redesigned navigation now serves as a robust, user-friendly foundation for internal operations.
